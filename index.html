    <meta name="description" content="I'm Batman Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. My anger outweights my guilt. This isn't a car. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea. This isn't a car. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Does it come in black? Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.">
